Data Structure - Trie:

The core of this approach is the use of a Trie data structure. A Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure used mainly for string manipulations. Each node in a Trie represents a character of a word, and the path from the root node to a particular node represents the prefix of words stored in that node.
This structure is particularly efficient for queries like prefix search, which makes it ideal for this problem where we need to check if a word or part of a word exists in the list.
Storing Words in Trie:

The program reads words from a file and inserts them into the Trie. Each node in the Trie corresponds to a character, and a flag in each node indicates whether it marks the end of a word.
Checking for Compound Words:

A compound word, in this context, is defined as a word that can be constructed by concatenating shorter words also found in the list.
The function isCompoundWord is designed to check if a given word is a compound word. It does this by recursively checking every possible prefix of the word. If a prefix is found in the Trie (indicating it is a valid word), the function then checks the remainder of the word in the same manner.
A word is identified as a compound word if it can be broken down into two or more valid words from the list.
Identifying Longest and Second-Longest Compound Words:

The program iterates through the list of words again, using the isCompoundWord function to check each word.
It keeps track of the longest and second-longest compound words found during this iteration.
Performance Optimization:

The use of Trie significantly reduces the search time complexity, making the program efficient even for large lists of words.
The recursive approach in isCompoundWord ensures that the program doesn't miss any potential compound words while avoiding redundant searches.
Time Measurement:

The program measures the time taken to process the list of words, from reading the file and inserting words into the Trie, to identifying the longest compound words. This is done using the <chrono> library, which provides tools for timing and duration measurement.
